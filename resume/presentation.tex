\cvsection{Presentation}

    I am a student of Computer Science with experience as a teaching assistant at my university and mobile development. 
    My passion for programming and software development has led me to acquire a deep understanding in these areas 
    and to participate in competitive programming contests such as the ACM-ICPC. With analytical and problem-solving abilities, 
    I enjoy tackling complex challenges and finding innovative solutions.
