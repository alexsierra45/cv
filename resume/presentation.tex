\cvsection{Presentation}

    I am a Computer Science student and professor at the University of Havana with experience as software developer. 
    My passion for programming and algorithmics has led me to acquire a deep understanding in these areas and to participate in 
    competitive programming contests such as the ACM-ICPC. I enjoy tackling complex challenges and finding innovative solutions 
    with analytical and problem-solving abilities.
